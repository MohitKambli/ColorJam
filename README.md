<h1>ColorJam</h1>
<p>ColorJam is a web application that allows the user to select/browse an image and fetch the dominant colors from it. 
This application is developed using React, a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies. This app's backend code written in Python programming language which hosted on https://www.pythonanywhere.com. 
The feature of fetching the dominant colors from the image is developed by using the K-Means clustering algorithm, implemented in Python. This algorithm  computes the centroids and iterates until it finds optimal centroid. It assumes that the number of clusters are already known. The number of clusters identified from data by algorithm is represented by 'K' in K-means.
In this algorithm, the data points are assigned to a cluster in such a manner that the sum of the squared distance between the data points and centroid would be minimum. It is to be understood that less variation within the clusters will lead to more similar data points within same cluster.
Working of K-Means Algorithm
We can understand the working of K-Means clustering algorithm with the help of following steps −
Step 1 − First, we need to specify the number of clusters, K, need to be generated by this algorithm.
Step 2 − Next, randomly select K data points and assign each data point to a cluster. In simple words, classify the data based on the number of data points.
Step 3 − Now it will compute the cluster centroids.
Step 4 − Next, keep iterating the following until we find optimal centroid which is the assignment of data points to the clusters that are not changing any more.

4.1 − First, the sum of squared distance between data points and centroids would be computed.
4.2 − Now, we have to assign each data point to the cluster that is closer than other cluster (centroid).
4.3 − At last compute the centroids for the clusters by taking the average of all data points of that cluster.
